description: Scaffold a new OpenSpec change and validate strictly.
model: openai/gpt-5.2-codex
---

The user has requested the following change proposal. Use the skill script at `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py"` to create their change proposal.
<UserRequest>
$ARGUMENTS
</UserRequest>

**NOTE**:
- Always consider the preceding conversation context to interpret the user's intent. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, summarize the conversation conclusions and create a proposal. If a change ID is not explicitly provided but can be inferred from context, use it without asking the user.

**MUST**: Bugfixes with no intended spec changes still need at least one minimal `## MODIFIED Requirements` delta (one requirement + one `#### Scenario:`) so `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" validate <id> --strict` passes.
**MUST**: If a task is not executable by the AI (requires human action, external systems, or long-wait verification), either move it to a Future work section or omit it from tasks.md entirely.

**External dependency policy (mock-first)**:
- Any requirement that AI cannot resolve or verify autonomously is an external dependency
- When designing tasks, prioritize mock/stub/fixture implementations for external dependencies to enable verification without external credentials
- Only truly non-mockable external dependencies (requiring real external systems, human decisions, or long-wait verification) should be marked for Out of Scope / Future Work
- Missing secrets (API keys, credentials) should NOT block proposal design; instead, include tasks for implementing mocks/stubs
- When creating tasks.md, include specific tasks for mock/stub/fixture implementation where applicable

**CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS**
- This command is for PROPOSAL CREATION ONLY
- DO NOT implement or modify source code
- DO NOT edit files outside `openspec/changes/` directory
- You may READ any files for context gathering
- You may WRITE only to `openspec/changes/<id>/` paths
- After proposal validation with `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" validate <id> --strict`, STOP and present the proposal to the user

<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- When user requirements can be decomposed into multiple independent proposals, actively create separate change proposals to enable parallel work.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.
- Identify any vague or ambiguous details and ask the necessary follow-up questions before editing files.

**Steps**
1. Review `openspec/project.md`, run `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" list` and `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" list --specs`, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via `rg`/`ls`) to ground the proposal in current behaviour; note any gaps that require clarification.
2. Choose a unique, verb-led, kebab-case `change-id` with no date prefixes/suffixes (forbidden: `2026-02-07-add-auth`, `add-auth-2026-02-07`) and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and `design.md` (when needed) under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.
3. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
4. Capture architectural reasoning in `design.md` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
5. Draft spec deltas in `changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (one folder per capability) using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
6. Draft `tasks.md` as an ordered list of small, verifiable work items that deliver user-visible progress, include validation (tests, tooling), and highlight dependencies or parallelizable work.
7. For any new capability, include explicit integration/entry-point tasks ("wire it into the execution path") and completion criteria (what code path proves it is used).
8. Each task must state how completion is verified (e.g., where it is called, the command/output that proves it, or the file/line to inspect).
9. Validate with `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" validate <id> --strict` and resolve every issue before sharing the proposal.

**Reference**
- Use `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" show <id> --json --deltas-only` or `python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" show <spec> --type spec` to inspect details when validation fails.
- Search existing requirements with `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with `rg <keyword>`, `ls`, or direct file reads so proposals align with current implementation realities.
