# Conflux Workflow Executor

Execute Conflux workflow operations autonomously. Called by orchestration system, not for direct human use.

**CRITICAL**: This skill CANNOT ask questions to users. All decisions must be made autonomously based on available context.

## Operation Modes

This skill supports three operations, determined by the orchestrator's invocation:

1. **apply** - Implement an approved change
2. **accept** - Verify implementation against specs
3. **archive** - Finalize a deployed change

## Operation Selection

The orchestrator specifies the operation. Parse the invocation to determine:

- If change ID with "apply" or "implement" context → Execute Apply
- If "accept" or "review" context → Execute Accept
- If "archive" context → Execute Archive

## Operation 1: Apply (Implementation)

**Purpose**: Implement an approved change autonomously with task tracking.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**:
- **NO QUESTIONS** - Make autonomous decisions based on available context
- **NO DEFERRAL** - Do not defer tasks based on difficulty or complexity
- **IMMEDIATE UPDATES** - Update `tasks.md` after EVERY completed task
- **COMPLETE ALL** - All tasks must be marked `[x]` or moved to Future Work
- **ESCALATE BLOCKERS** - If implementation is impossible, record an Implementation Blocker for acceptance review

### Execution Steps

1. **Read Proposal**
   ```bash
   python scripts/cflx.py show <change-id>
   ```
   - Read `openspec/changes/<id>/proposal.md`
   - Read `openspec/changes/<id>/design.md` (if exists)
   - Read `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md`

2. **Work Through Tasks Sequentially**
   - Start with first uncompleted task
   - Implement the change
   - Run verification (build/test/lint)
   - Mark task as `[x]` in `tasks.md` immediately
   - Proceed to next task

3. **Handle Ambiguity Autonomously**
   - Use existing code patterns as reference
   - Make reasonable assumptions
   - Document decisions in code comments
   - Prefer simpler solutions

4. **Update Progress Continuously**
   - Update `tasks.md` after each task
   - Never batch updates
   - Keep progress visible

5. **Verify Completion**
   - Ensure all tasks are `[x]` or in Future Work
   - Run final validation
   - Confirm integration points

### Task Management

**Move to Future Work ONLY if**:
1. Requires human decision-making or judgment
2. Requires external system access outside repository
3. Requires long-wait verification (>1 day)
4. Already marked with '(future work)'

**Do NOT move to Future Work**:
- Difficult or complex tasks (agent must attempt)
- Tests (unit/integration/e2e)
- Linting/formatting
- Documentation updates
- Any automatable task

### Checkbox Rules

**Active sections**: Must have checkboxes `- [ ]` or `- [x]`

**Excluded sections** (Future Work, Out of Scope, Notes): Must NOT have checkboxes

```markdown
## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task

## Future Work
- Manual verification required
- External deployment needed
```

### Mock-First Policy

- Mock external dependencies when possible
- Do not block on missing API keys/credentials
- Implement stub/fixture for external services
- Only truly non-mockable dependencies go to Future Work

### Implementation Blocker Escalation

If apply determines the change is currently impossible to implement (for example: spec contradiction, non-mockable external limitation, or policy constraint), do not loop blindly.

1. Add a new section to `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Blocker #<n>
   - category: <spec_contradiction|external_non_mockable|policy_constraint|other>
   - summary: <one-line human-facing blocker summary>
   - evidence:
      - <file/path:line or concrete command output>
   - impact: <what cannot be completed>
   - unblock_actions:
      - <specific follow-up action 1>
      - <specific follow-up action 2>
   - owner: <team_or_role>
   - decision_due: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```
2. The blocker section is human-facing and MUST NOT use checkboxes.
3. Output a machine-readable marker at the end of apply output:
   ```text
   IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKER:
   category: <...>
   tasks_section: "Implementation Blocker #<n>"
   human_action_required: see openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md#implementation-blocker-<n>
   ```
4. Keep evidence concrete and actionable so acceptance can judge whether loop stop is warranted.

### Apply Completion Criteria

- All tasks marked `[x]` or moved to Future Work (without checkboxes)
- Code compiles/builds successfully
- Tests pass
- Lint passes
- Integration points verified

**For detailed guidance**, read [references/cflx-apply.md](references/cflx-apply.md).

## Operation 2: Accept (Acceptance Review)

**Purpose**: Verify implementation meets specifications with automated checks.

**CRITICAL**: Output exactly ONE verdict at the end.

### Required Checks

1. **Git Working Tree Clean**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   - Must output empty (no uncommitted changes)
   - If dirty, output FAIL with all changed files

2. **Task Completion**
   - All tasks marked `[x]` or in Future Work section
   - No checkboxes in excluded sections

3. **Spec Matching**
   - Implementation matches specification in `specs/`
   - All scenarios are satisfied

4. **Integration Check**
   - Feature is executed in real flow
   - Called from CLI/TUI/API as specified

5. **Dead Code Check**
   - All implemented code is invoked
   - No orphan functions/classes

6. **Regression Check**
   - Existing features still work
   - No unintended side effects

7. **Evidence Citation**
   - Cite file path + function/method for integration
   - Provide concrete verification evidence

### Output Format

Output exactly ONE of these at the end:

**PASS**:
```
ACCEPTANCE: PASS
```

**FAIL**:
```
ACCEPTANCE: FAIL

FINDINGS:
1. [file:line] Description of issue
2. [file:line] Description of issue
...
```
Then update `tasks.md` with:
```markdown
## Acceptance #N Failure Follow-up

- [ ] Fix issue 1
- [ ] Fix issue 2
```

**CONTINUE** (only if verification incomplete):
```
ACCEPTANCE: CONTINUE
```

**BLOCKED** (when blocker escalation is valid):
```
ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED

BLOCKER:
- category: <...>
- reason: <short rationale>
- evidence: <file/path:line or command evidence>

Recommended:
- summary: <one-line human-facing blocker summary>
- unblock_actions:
  - <specific follow-up action 1>
  - <specific follow-up action 2>
```

### Accept Rules

- Each finding must include concrete evidence (file path, function, line)
- Each finding must be actionable by AI agent
- Missing secrets MUST NOT cause CONTINUE if mocking is possible
- Dirty working tree is always FAIL
- `ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED` is allowed only when a valid `Implementation Blocker #<n>` exists with concrete evidence and unblock actions
- If blocker data is weak, speculative, or fixable within repo scope, return FAIL instead of BLOCKED

**For detailed guidance**, read [references/cflx-accept.md](references/cflx-accept.md).

## Operation 3: Archive

**Purpose**: Archive deployed change and update canonical specs.

### Execution Steps

1. **Identify Change ID**
   - From orchestrator invocation
   - Or from context (must be unambiguous)

2. **Validate Change Status**
   ```bash
   python scripts/cflx.py list
   python scripts/cflx.py show <id>
   ```
   - Ensure change exists
   - Ensure not already archived
   - Ensure ready for archive

3. **Run Archive**
   ```bash
   python scripts/cflx.py archive <id> --yes
   ```
   - Use `--skip-specs` only for tooling-only changes

4. **Verify Results**
   - Confirm moved to `changes/archive/`
   - Confirm specs updated
   ```bash
   python scripts/cflx.py validate --strict
   ```

### Archive Completion Criteria

- Change moved to `openspec/changes/archive/<id>/`
- Canonical specs updated (unless `--skip-specs`)
- Validation passes with `--strict`

**For detailed guidance**, read [references/cflx-archive.md](references/cflx-archive.md).

## Built-in Tools

```bash
# List changes
python scripts/cflx.py list

# List specs
python scripts/cflx.py list --specs

# Show change details
python scripts/cflx.py show <id>

# Show JSON output
python scripts/cflx.py show <id> --json

# Show deltas only
python scripts/cflx.py show <id> --json --deltas-only

# Validate change
python scripts/cflx.py validate <id> --strict

# Validate all
python scripts/cflx.py validate --strict

# Archive change
python scripts/cflx.py archive <id> --yes

# Archive without spec updates
python scripts/cflx.py archive <id> --yes --skip-specs
```

## Autonomous Decision Framework

When facing ambiguous situations, follow this priority:

1. **Existing patterns** - Follow patterns in the codebase
2. **Specification** - Refer to spec deltas and scenarios
3. **Simplicity** - Choose simpler implementation
4. **Documentation** - Document decision in code comments

**Never**:
- Ask user for clarification
- Stop and wait for input
- Leave tasks incomplete due to uncertainty

## Task Format Requirements

**Valid**:
```markdown
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Completed task
1. [ ] Numbered task
```

**Invalid** (must fix):
```markdown
## N. Task              → - [ ] N. Task
- Task                 → - [ ] Task
1. Task                → 1. [ ] Task
```

If `0/0 tasks detected`, fix format first.

## Error Handling

### Validation Failure
1. Parse error messages
2. Fix identified issues
3. Re-run validation
4. Repeat until passing

### Build/Test Failure
1. Analyze error output
2. Fix code issues
3. Re-run verification
4. Update tasks on success

### Incomplete Information
1. Make reasonable assumption
2. Implement based on assumption
3. Document assumption in code
4. Continue with next task
