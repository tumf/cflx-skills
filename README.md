# CFLX Skills

Conflux workflow management skills for AI coding assistants.

## Overview

This repository contains two complementary skills for managing the Conflux (OpenSpec-based) change lifecycle:

```
[Human] → cflx-proposal → Proposal Creation (interactive)
                ↓
        [Conflux Orchestrator]
                ↓
        cflx-workflow (apply) → Implementation (autonomous)
                ↓
        cflx-workflow (accept) → Verification (autonomous)
                ↓
        cflx-workflow (archive) → Finalization (autonomous)
```

## Skills

### cflx-proposal

**Purpose**: Create structured change proposals through interactive conversation with users.

**Characteristics**:
- Human-interactive mode
- Asks clarifying questions
- Guides users through proposal structure
- Iterates based on feedback

**Triggers**:
- "Create a proposal for..."
- "Draft a change proposal"
- "Propose a new feature"

### cflx-workflow

**Purpose**: Execute Conflux workflow operations autonomously without user interaction.

**Characteristics**:
- Called by orchestration system
- Cannot ask questions
- Makes autonomous decisions
- Three operations: apply, accept, archive

**Operations**:

| Operation | Purpose | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Apply | Implement approved changes | Completed tasks + code |
| Accept | Verify implementation | PASS / FAIL / CONTINUE / BLOCKED |
| Archive | Finalize deployed changes | Archived change + updated specs |

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add tumf/cflx-skills
```

This will install both skills:
- `cflx-proposal` - For interactive proposal creation
- `cflx-workflow` - For autonomous workflow execution

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**: Required for the built-in `"$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py"` tool
- **Git**: For version control operations
- **No Node.js required**: All operations are implemented in Python

## Built-in Tools

Both skills include `"$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py"`, a standalone Python implementation that replaces the need for `@fission-ai/openspec` npm package.

```bash
# List changes
python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" list

# List specs
python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" list --specs

# Show change details
python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" show <id>

# Validate change
python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" validate <id> --strict

# Archive change
python3 "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cflx.py" archive <id> --yes
```

## Key Principles

### Mock-First External Dependencies

- Mock/stub/fixture external dependencies for verification
- Do not block on missing API keys or credentials
- Only truly non-mockable dependencies go to Future Work

### Task Management

- Update `tasks.md` immediately after each task completion
- Active sections must have checkboxes (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`)
- Future Work sections must NOT have checkboxes

### Implementation Blocker Gate

- Apply can escalate `IMPLEMENTATION_BLOCKER` when implementation is truly impossible in current loop
- Accept can return `ACCEPTANCE: BLOCKED` only with concrete blocker evidence

### Autonomous Execution (cflx-workflow only)

- No questions allowed during execution
- Make decisions based on available context
- Do not defer tasks based on difficulty
